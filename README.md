# perf-eval

Run accuracy + perf workloads against vLLM, defined by small YAML recipes in `workloads/`.

Each recipe is one `(model, hardware, set of tasks)` combination. The Buildkite pipeline picks recipes up automatically — to ship a new run, you write a YAML file, push it, and trigger a build.

## Repo layout

## How to use this repo

### Add a new recipe

1. Copy an existing workload that targets the same GPU — e.g. `workloads/qwen3_5_h200.yaml` is a small, complete example.
2. Name the file `<model>_<hardware>.yaml`. Keep hardware variants in separate files.
3. Edit the fields to match your model and tasks. Set `nightly: true` if it should run in the nightly schedule; leave it off for opt-in recipes.
4. Open a PR. The pipeline auto-discovers `workloads/*.yaml` — no Buildkite YAML edits needed.

### Recipe schema

A recipe has top-level metadata plus up to three eval blocks:

- **`vllm:`** — *how the server runs.* Defines what model to serve and how (`model`, `serve_args`, optional image/env overrides). Required.
- **`lm_eval:`** — *what accuracy to measure.* Lists lm-evaluation-harness tasks to run against the live server (e.g. `gsm8k`, `aime25`). Each task's score is saved under `results/<name>/<task-name>/`. Optional.
- **`vllm_bench:`** — *what perf to measure.* Lists `vllm bench serve` configs (input/output lengths, concurrency, dataset). Raw JSON is saved and ingested into the perf dashboard. Optional.
- **`bfcl:`** — *function-calling eval.* Runs [BFCL](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/tree/main/berkeley-function-call-leaderboard) test categories against the live server. Some models need `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and `--tool-call-parser` in `serve_args`. Results are transformed to lm_eval format and ingested as `bfcl_<category>` tasks. Optional.

Include one or more of `lm_eval:` / `vllm_bench:` / `bfcl:` depending on what you want out of this recipe.

```

A few things worth knowing:

- **`gpu`** must match a key in `lib/gpu_profiles.yaml`. The profile sets the Buildkite queue, default image, HF cache path, and baseline env vars.
- **`nightly`** controls only the nightly schedule. Recipes with `nightly: false` (or omitted) are still triggerable explicitly via the `WORKLOADS` env var.
- **`lm_eval.tasks` is a list** because each entry runs as a separate `lm_eval` invocation — `--num_fewshot` is a single global flag, so different shot counts need separate runs. Each task's results land in `results/<name>/<task-name>/`.
- **`vllm_bench` runs first** if both blocks are present — that way perf-pipeline bugs surface quickly instead of waiting on a full lm-eval pass.
- **`vllm_bench` uses the `random` dataset with `--ignore-eos`** so every request prefills exactly `input_len` and decodes exactly `output_len` tokens — that's what makes the per-GPU decode throughput meaningful. Pair it with `backend: openai` (the `/v1/completions` endpoint) for exact token control. Avoid `dataset: speed_bench` for throughput numbers: it requires `--skip-tokenizer-init`, which makes `vllm bench serve` cap every request at a single output token, so output throughput reads as ~0.
- **`vllm_bench.configs[].args` forwards additional options to `vllm bench serve`.** Keys may use underscores, hyphens, or a leading `--`; they are normalized to `--kebab-case`. A `true` value emits a standalone flag, `false` and `null` omit it, scalar values emit a flag/value pair, and lists repeat the flag. Options managed by perf-eval itself, including the model, endpoint, dataset, request counts, lengths, concurrency, and result path, remain top-level config fields and cannot be overridden through `args`.
- **`bfcl` may need tool-call serve args.** Some models require `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and `--tool-call-parser` for function-calling; the parser warns if `--tool-call-parser` is absent. Each category runs as a separate generate + evaluate pass; scores appear on the eval dashboard as `bfcl_<category>` tasks.
- **`bfcl.maximum_step_limit`** caps how many inference steps BFCL allows per multi-turn turn (default 10 in perf-eval; BFCL upstream defaults to 20). Set it in the workload YAML, or override per-run with the `BFCL_MAXIMUM_STEP_LIMIT` env var (env wins over YAML). Useful for agentic / long multi-turn categories.
- **`bfcl.max_test_cases`** subsamples a category instead of running the full set — e.g. `multi_turn` (~800 cases) down to 300. For aggregate groups with multiple subcategories, the cap is split evenly across subcategories (by BFCL id order within each). Set a single integer to cap every category, or a map per category (`multi_turn: 240`). Override per-run with `BFCL_MAX_TEST_CASES`. Scores are partial-eval only and are not comparable to full BFCL leaderboard numbers.

For everything else (the full set of supported fields, defaults, validation rules), the existing files in `workloads/` are the working reference and `lib/parse_workload.py` is the source of truth.

### Trigger a Buildkite build

The pipeline is [**`vllm/perf-eval`**](https://buildkite.com/vllm/perf-eval). With no extra config, a build runs every workload that has `nightly: true`.

**From the UI:** open the pipeline → New Build → pick branch and commit (must be pushed to GitHub) → optionally fill Environment Variables to scope the run → Create Build.

**Required env vars** — both must be set on every build:

- `VLLM_COMMIT` — vLLM commit SHA being tested. Used to tag results and track which vLLM version produced them.
- `VLLM_IMAGE` — full Docker image URI (e.g. `vllm/vllm-openai:nightly-abc1234`). This is the image that gets pulled and run.

**Optional env vars:**

- `WORKLOADS` — comma- or newline-separated list of workload paths or stems. Runs exactly those instead of the default `nightly: true` set.
- `NIGHTLY` — set to `1` to tag every ingested row with `nightly: true`. The dashboard's `/nightly` view filters on this to pair adjacent nightly builds; only the scheduled nightly cron should set it.

**Example — trigger a build from the Buildkite UI:**

1. Open the `vllm/perf-eval` pipeline → **New Build**.
2. Pick the branch and commit (must already be pushed to GitHub).
3. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   VLLM_COMMIT=abc1234def5678
   VLLM_IMAGE=vllm/vllm-openai:nightly-abc1234def5678
   WORKLOADS=qwen3_5_h200
   ```
4. Click **Create Build**.

This runs the `qwen3_5_h200` workload against the specified vLLM nightly image. Omit `WORKLOADS` to run all `nightly: true` workloads.

**From an agent:** see `CLAUDE.md` for the Buildkite MCP workflow (don't shell out to `curl` or `bk`).

### Run a recipe end-to-end

A real run needs a GPU host with Docker, vLLM, and lm-eval available:

```bash
./lib/run.sh workloads/qwen3_5_h200.yaml
```

Locally, you can smoke-test recipe changes without a GPU — see `CLAUDE.md` for the parser stub and shell-syntax checks.

## Agents

`CLAUDE.md` has conventions for AI agents working in this repo: smoke-testing changes, launching Buildkite builds for a chosen branch/commit, and the AI-assistance disclosure rule for PRs and commits.
